This should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm your consent video and check that your child is in the age range for this study. <br><br><u>Following is more information about the study you participated in:</u><br> In this study, we are testing if infants’ might have different expectations about how people from the same racial background versus different racial backgrounds interact. To try to answer this question, we are using the fact that infants tend to look longer when they see a surprising event. We are curious if infants will look longer (i.e., be more “surprised”) when they see people from different racial backgrounds interact versus people from the same racial backgrounds interact. We are also interested in how infants’ own exposure to different races and language speakers - through their neighborhood or in their daily lives - might influence infants’ looking patterns. Your baby’s looking pattern to the videos and your survey responses will help us get closer to understanding how social experience early in life shapes infants’ thinking about race.",
