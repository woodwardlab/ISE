This should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we verify your consent video and check that your child is in the age range for this study.<br><br><u>Following is more information about the study you participated in:</u></b><br> In this study, each baby is randomly assigned to see either two people of the same race or two people of different races. Your baby may have seen two White women or two Black women, or one Black woman and one White woman. All babies saw the two people alternate between interacting in a friendly way and an unfriendly way. In future studies, we plan to add more people from other racial backgrounds as well.<br><br>In this study, we are testing whether infants might have different expectations about how people of the same race interact, versus people of different races. To try to answer this question, we are using the fact that babies tend to look longer at things they find surprising. We expect babies will overall prefer to look at the friendly interactions just because those are nicer to see! However, we are curious if babies will look longer at (or be more “surprised” by) the friendly interactions compared to unfriendly interactions when the people are of different races. This would suggest that babies already have expectations about how people interact based on race.<br><br>Of course, many other things will influence what your baby looked at most - for instance, maybe one of the women looked familiar or your baby got distracted sometimes. We can’t tell anything about how an individual baby thinks about race or about these interactions based on their looking times. Instead, we average across multiple trials and across many babies to find an average response, and look for consistent overall patterns.<br><br>We are also interested in how babies’ exposure to people from different racial and linguistic backgrounds - through their neighborhood or in their daily lives - might influence looking patterns. Your baby’s looking pattern to the videos and your survey responses will help us get closer to understanding how social experiences early in life relate to infants’ attention to people from different racial backgrounds.<br><br>If you are interested in learning more, you can check out <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/7/1535/files/2018/11/Preverbal-Infants-Infer-Third-Party-Social-Relationships-Based-on-Language_2016-11q5you.pdf\"> this research article </a> from our group and please visit our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://voices.uchicago.edu/woodwardlab/projects/\"> website</a>.

Through our research, we hope to better understand children’s early reasoning, and how that thinking changes as they grow older, in order to paint a clearer picture of development for scientists, parents and educators. In today's study, we are investigating how social categories (such as race and language groups) and social experiences affect children’s learning. Our goal in these studies is to see what children naturally do in response to seeing people interact and whether they pay attention to the person's race when processing these interactions. Please understand that there are no right or wrong answers. Our findings do not allow us to draw meaningful conclusions about an individual child’s abilities, although they can provide information about general patterns in infant development.",

We are interested in what babies think about people and their interactions according to the race of the people they saw. We will ask you (the parent) to turn around, close your eyes, or look down to avoid influencing your child's responses. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating. To better understand your child's social environment, we will also ask you to fill out a questionnaire after the experiment and an additional survey about the people your child interacts with regularly.",
